    "# Growth of Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order of growth**: simple characterization of the algorithm's efficiency, relative performance to other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "extra precision of determining exactly the running time is not useful\n",
    "\n",
    "for large enough inputs, the running time will be dominated by the effects of the size itself: studying **asymptotic** effiency\n",
    "\n",
    "methods for simplifying the asymptotic analysis of algorithms' running times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 -Asymptotic Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions whose domains are the set of natural number $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, ..., n, ...\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential abuse of notation: extension to numbers of the real domain or resriction to a subset of $\\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Asymptotic notation, functions, and running time\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic notation is primarily used to describe running time of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could also be used to characterize the amount of space used in memory, and other aspects of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to clarify _which_ running time we describe: worst-case scenario, the running time no matter what the input is  -- all cases for which asymptotic notation is well suited\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\Theta$-notation\n",
    "\n",
    "for a given function $g(n)$, we denote $\\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ the set of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right) = \\{ f(n): \\text{ there exist positive constants } c_1, c_2 \\text{ and } n_0 \\text{ such that } 0 \\leq c_1 g(n) \\leq f(n) \\leq c_2 g(n) \\space \\forall n \\leq n_0 \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ is a set, therefore $f(n) \\in \\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ -- abuse: $f(n) = \\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(n)$ is an **asymptotically tight bound** for $f(n)$ (from above and below)\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of $\\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ requires that any member $f(n) \\in \\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ be **asymptotically nonnengative** i.e. $f(n)$ is nonnegative for $n$ sufficiently large\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $g(n)$ must also be nonnegative or the set is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "  - we assume that every function used with the $\\Theta$-notation is asymptotically nonnegative, this holds for the other asymptotic notations\n",
    "  \n",
    "In general, for any polynomial $p(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} a_i n^i$, where $a_i$ are constants and $a_d > 0$, $p(n) = \\Theta \\left( n^d \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Any constant function: $\\Theta \\left( n^0 \\right) = \\Theta(1)$ -- abuse: there is no indication of what variable is tending to infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $O$-notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**asymptotic upper bound**: for a given function $g(n)$, we denote $O \\left(g(n)\\right)$ the set of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$O \\left(g(n)\\right) = \\{ f(n): \\text{ there exist positive constants } c \\text{ and } n_0 \\text{ such that } 0 \\leq f(n) \\leq c g(n) \\space \\forall n \\leq n_0 \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$O \\left(g(n)\\right)$ is a set, therefore $f(n) \\in O \\left(g(n)\\right)$ -- abuse: $f(n) = O \\left(g(n)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "  - $f(n) = \\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ implies $f(n) = O \\left(g(n)\\right)$ or, written set-theoretically $\\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right) \\subseteq O \\left(g(n)\\right)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - $O$-notation describes an upper bound - we can use it to bound the worst-case running time of an algorithm on every input, it does not imply that this worst-case scenario bound _every_ input\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\Omega$-notation\n",
    "\n",
    "**asymptotic lower bound**: for a given function $g(n)$, we denote $\\Omega \\left(g(n)\\right)$ the set of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega \\left(g(n)\\right) = \\{ f(n): \\text{ there exist positive constants } c \\text{ and } n_0 \\text{ such that } 0 \\leq c g(n) \\leq f(n) \\space \\forall n \\leq n_0 \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**theorem**: for any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \\Theta \\left(g(n)\\right)$ if and only if $f(n) = O \\left(g(n)\\right)$ and $f(n) = \\Omega \\left(g(n)\\right)$\n",
