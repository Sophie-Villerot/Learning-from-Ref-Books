    "### 3 - Designing algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide range of algorihm design techniques. `insertion_sort` is based on **incremental** approach. An alternative design approach is the \"divide-and-conquer\", whose algorithms have running times that can easily be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The divide-and-conquer approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Many algorithms use **recursive** structure: to solve a given problem, they call themselves one or several times to solve closely related subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **divide-and-conquer** approach involves 3 steps:\n",
    "  - **Divide** the problem into subproblems, smaller instances of the same problem;\n",
    "  - **Conquer** those subproblems with recursive solving, or in a straightforward manner if small enough;\n",
    "  - **Combine** the solutions of those subproblems into the solution of the original problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Example of the `merge_sort`algorithm:\n",
    "  - **Divide** the unsorted $n$-element sequence is divided into 2 subsequences of size $n/2$ elements;\n",
    "  - **Conquer** the 2 subsequences are sorted out recursively using `merge_sort`;\n",
    "  - **Combine** the 2 newly sorted subsequences are merged to produce the wanted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion ends when the subsequences have a size of length $1$. The key operation is the **combine** step, which is called `merge`. The input is an array $A$, divided into 2 sorted subarrays $A[p..q]$ and $A[q+1..r]$ with $p \\leq q < r$. The output is the merged single sorted array that replaces $A[p..r]$. This procedure takes time $\\Theta (n)$ where $n = r-p+1$, the total number of elements to be sorted."
